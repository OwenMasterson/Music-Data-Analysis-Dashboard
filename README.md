# Music-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project explores Spotify music data to understand how genres and artists differ across key audio features such as popularity, acousticness, loudness, liveness, and danceability. Using Tableau, I created interactive dashboards to uncover trends that support recommendation systems, playlist strategy, and audience segmentation.
# Executive Summary
The analysis highlights clear distinctions in how genres and artists perform across multiple audio metrics. Popularity, acousticness, loudness, and liveness vary significantly between genres, while artists show strong differences in total track duration, danceability, and listener engagement. These insights can support recommendation systems, content strategy, and broader music‑industry decision‑making.

# Dashboard Insights
## 🔥 Popularity in Genres
Some genres consistently attract higher listener engagement, indicating strong audience preference clusters. These patterns can guide playlist curation and marketing focus.

## 🎸 Acoustic Levels in Genres
Acousticness varies widely across genres. Acoustic‑heavy genres stand out clearly, offering opportunities for mood‑based recommendations and genre‑specific analysis.

## ⭐ Popularity in Artists
Artist popularity shows substantial variation, highlighting the importance of audience segmentation and trend monitoring.

## 🔉 Loudness in Genres
Classical, Opera, and Soundtrack genres show the lowest loudness levels due to their dynamic range and traditional production styles. Jazz, World, and Folk trend moderately higher.

## 🎤 Liveness in Genres
Comedy and Opera exhibit the highest liveness values, reflecting frequent live‑performance recordings. Electronic, Hip‑hop, Reggaeton, Blues, and Rock sit in a mid‑range, suggesting a mix of studio and live elements.

## ⏱️ Total Duration per Artist
Classical composers such as Verdi, Puccini, Mozart, and Beethoven dominate total duration because of long‑form compositions. Modern artists like Drake show shorter cumulative durations, aligning with contemporary track structures.


💃 Danceability by Artist
Children’s and pop‑oriented artists (e.g., Minions Children’s Music, Juice Music) score highest in danceability. Classical composers sit at the lower end, consistent with their rhythmic complexity.

# Strategic Value
This analysis provides a foundation for deeper exploration into:

Genre‑based audience behavior

Artist performance and catalog strategy

Audio‑feature‑driven recommendation models

Playlist design and content curation

Market trend identification

## Future Improvements
- Add predictive modelling for genre recommendation.
- Integrate Python analysis for deeper statistical insights.
- Expand dashboards with user‑behavior metrics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how audio features can reveal meaningful patterns in genre behavior, artist performance, and listener engagement. The dashboards provide a foundation for recommendation systems, playlist strategy, and broader music‑industry insights.


## Data Source
The dataset is based on Spotify audio features and metadata. It includes metrics such as popularity, acousticness, loudness, liveness, danceability, and track duration.

The dashboards demonstrate how measurable audio attributes can inform data‑driven decisions in music‑focused projects.
