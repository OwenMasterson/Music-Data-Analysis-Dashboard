# Music-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project explores Spotify music data to understand how genres and artists differ across key audio features such as popularity, acousticness, loudness, liveness, and danceability. Using Tableau, I created interactive dashboards that reveal patterns in listener behaviour, artist performance, and genre characteristics. These insights support recommendation systems, playlist strategy, and audience segmentation within the music‑streaming landscape.

# Executive Summary
The analysis highlights clear distinctions in how genres and artists perform across multiple audio metrics. Popularity, acousticness, loudness, and liveness vary significantly between genres, while artists show strong differences in total track duration, danceability, and listener engagement. These insights can support recommendation systems, content strategy, and broader music‑industry decision‑making.

# Dashboard Insights
## 🔥 Popularity in Genres
Some genres consistently attract higher listener engagement, indicating strong audience preference clusters. These patterns can guide playlist curation, targeted marketing, and genre‑specific promotional strategies.

## 🎸 Acoustic Levels in Genres
Acousticness varies widely across genres. Acoustic‑heavy genres stand out clearly, offering opportunities for mood‑based recommendations and genre‑specific analysis.

## ⭐ Popularity in Artists
Artist popularity shows substantial variation, highlighting the importance of audience segmentation and trend monitoring.

## 🔉 Loudness in Genres
Classical, Opera, and Soundtrack genres show the lowest loudness levels due to their dynamic range and traditional production styles. Jazz, World, and Folk trend moderately higher.

## 🎤 Liveness in Genres
Comedy and Opera exhibit the highest liveness values, reflecting frequent live‑performance recordings. Electronic, Hip‑hop, Reggaeton, Blues, and Rock sit in a mid‑range, suggesting a mix of studio and live elements.

## ⏱️ Total Duration per Artist
Classical composers such as Verdi, Puccini, Mozart, and Beethoven dominate total duration because of long‑form compositions. Modern artists like Drake show shorter cumulative durations, aligning with contemporary track structures.


💃 Danceability by Artist
Children’s and pop‑oriented artists (e.g., Minions Children’s Music, Juice Music) score highest in danceability. Classical composers sit at the lower end, consistent with their rhythmic complexity.

# Technical Skills Demonstrated
### Tableau Dashboard Design 
Built interactive dashboards using filters, tooltips, and multi‑chart layouts to highlight genre and artist patterns.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation 
Ensured audio‑feature fields were structured, consistent, and ready for visual analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Identified trends in popularity, loudness, acousticness, liveness, and danceability across genres and artists.

### Data Storytelling  
Translated complex audio metrics into clear insights for strategic decision‑making.

### Insight Communication 
Structured findings in a way that supports recommendation systems, playlist strategy, and audience segmentation

# Strategic Value
This analysis provides a foundation for deeper exploration into:
* Genre‑based audience behaviour
* Artist performance and catalogue strategy
* Audio‑feature‑driven recommendation models
* Playlist design and content curation
* Market trend identification
* Feature engineering for machine‑learning models
* Understanding how audio attributes influence listener engagement

These insights demonstrate how measurable audio characteristics can support data‑driven decisions in music‑focused projects.

# How to Use the Dashboards
### Explore Genre Trends  
Use the genre filters to compare audio features such as popularity, loudness, acousticness, and liveness. This helps identify which genres perform strongly across different listener‑focused metrics.

### Analyse Artist Performance  
Hover over data points to view artist‑specific values for danceability, total track duration, and popularity. This is useful for understanding catalogue structure and audience engagement.

### Switch Between Dashboards  
Dashboard 1 and Dashboard 2 offer different analytical perspectives. Use both to gain a fuller understanding of how audio features vary across the dataset.

### Apply Insights to Real‑World Scenarios  
The dashboards can support tasks such as playlist curation, trend monitoring, recommendation‑model feature selection, and market analysis.
Interact With Visual Elements  
Tooltips, colour coding, and chart layouts are designed to make comparisons intuitive. Hover, click, and filter to reveal deeper insights
# Future Improvements
* Add predictive modelling for genre or artist recommendation
* Integrate Python analysis for deeper statistical insights
* Expand dashboards with user‑behaviour metrics (skips, saves, completion rate)
* Build a machine‑learning model using audio features
* Add sentiment analysis from lyrics (if dataset available)
* Include time‑series analysis to track genre trends over time

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how audio features can reveal meaningful patterns in genre behaviour, artist performance, and listener engagement. The dashboards provide a strong foundation for recommendation systems, playlist strategy, and broader music‑industry insights. By combining visual analytics with domain understanding, this work showcases how data can shape strategic decisions in the streaming ecosystem.


# Data Source
The dataset is based on Spotify audio features and metadata. It includes metrics such as popularity, acousticness, loudness, liveness, danceability, and track duration.

The dashboards demonstrate how measurable audio attributes can inform data‑driven decisions in music‑focused projects.
